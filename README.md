# Go Playground

This repository contains a set of Go exercises and projects, each focusing on different programming concepts and challenges. These projects are built to enhance your understanding of Go and cover various topics, from algorithmic exercises to real-world applications.

## Projects

### animal-magic
Solves the **Animal Magic** exercise on Exercism, which focuses on string manipulation and understanding Go's handling of Unicode characters.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/animal-magic.

### annalyns-infiltration
Solves the **Annalyn's Infiltration** exercise on Exercism, an introductory exercise to conditionals and control flow.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/annalyns-infiltration.

### bird-watcher
Solves the **Bird Watcher** exercise on Exercism, focusing on slice manipulation and basic analytics.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/bird-watcher.

### blackjack
Solves the **Blackjack** exercise on Exercism, involving control flow and strategy based on card game rules.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/blackjack.

### bloom-filter
Implements a **Bloom Filter**, a probabilistic data structure used for efficient membership testing with a low probability of false positives. This implementation uses Go's type parameters (generics) to support multiple data types, such as `string`, `int`, and `int64`. It demonstrates working with hash functions and bit manipulation. The Bloom Filter is useful in scenarios where space efficiency is crucial, such as caching, spam filters, or database query optimizations.

### bookstore
Implements a **Bookstore Inventory Manager**, a project designed to manage a bookstore's inventory. It demonstrates working with Go structs, methods, and slices, and includes features for creating books, adding them to the bookstore, checking stock levels, selling books, and calculating inventory value.

### card-tricks
Solves the **Card Tricks** exercise on Exercism, focusing on working with arrays and slices.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/card-tricks.

### cars-assemble
Solves the **Cars Assemble** exercise on Exercism, focusing on control flow and working with simple calculations.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/cars-assemble.

### collatz-conjecture
Solves the **Collatz Conjecture** exercise on Exercism, implementing the famous mathematical sequence problem (also known as the 3n + 1 problem).
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/collatz-conjecture.

### difference-of-squares
Solves the **Difference of Squares** exercise on Exercism, focusing on basic arithmetic operations and loops.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/difference-of-squares.

### fizzbuzz
A classic **FizzBuzz** implementation, where numbers divisible by 3 or 5 are replaced with "Fizz" or "Buzz". Demonstrates control flow and modulus operations.

### guess-game
Implements a simple **number guessing game**, where the player attempts to guess a randomly chosen number within a set range. Focuses on generating random numbers and handling user input.

### hello-world
The basic **Hello World** program to get started with Go. Demonstrates Go's syntax and structure.

### isogram
Solves the **Isogram** exercise on Exercism, focusing on working with strings to identify whether a word contains repeating letters.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/isogram.

### lasagna
Solves the **Gopher's Gorgeous Lasagna** exercise on Exercism, focusing on learning basic functions and return values.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/lasagna.

### luhn
Solves the **Luhn** exercise on Exercism, implementing the Luhn algorithm for validating credit card numbers.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/luhn.

### need-for-speed
Solves the **Need For Speed** exercise on Exercism, focusing on simulating a racing car with different speeds and fuel levels.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/need-for-speed.

### party-robot
Solves the **Party Robot** exercise on Exercism, practicing string formatting and control flow.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/party-robot.

### raindrops
Solves the **Raindrops** exercise on Exercism, implementing string manipulation based on divisibility rules.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/raindrops.

### scrabble-score
Solves the **Scrabble Score** exercise on Exercism, calculating word scores based on letter values.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/scrabble-score.

### two-fer
Solves the **Two Fer** exercise on Exercism, focusing on functions and string interpolation.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/two-fer.

### vehicle-purchase
Solves the **Vehicle Purchase** exercise on Exercism, involving decision-making based on user input.
See: https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises/vehicle-purchase.

### welcome-to-tech-palace
Solves the **Welcome to Tech Palace** exercise on Exercism, demonstrating text formatting and manipulation.
